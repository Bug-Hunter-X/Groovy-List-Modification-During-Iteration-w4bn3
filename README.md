This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Groovy related to modifying a list while iterating over it using the each method.  The bug arises from the list's size changing during iteration, resulting in elements being skipped. The solution shows a safer way to achieve the desired outcome using a different iteration technique.  This is important to understand to prevent unexpected behavior in your Groovy applications.
